🌫️ Air Quality Time Series Analysis
This project was completed as part of my coursework at WorldQuant University, focusing on analyzing and forecasting air quality trends using time series techniques.

📌 Project Overview:
Database Integration: Queried and extracted air quality data from a MongoDB database to perform time series analysis.

Modeling Techniques: Implemented time series forecasting models including:

Autoregression (AR)

AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

Environment: The code was developed and tested using Jupyter Notebook.

Execution Instructions: To run this project, simply paste the provided .ipynb files into a Jupyter Notebook environment with access to your MongoDB instance.

Visual Results: Final forecast plots and performance outputs are included as images for reference.
